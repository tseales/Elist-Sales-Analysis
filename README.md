# Elist Sales Analysis
Founded in 2018, Elist is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics products and has since expanded to a global customer base. With this expansion, Elist has become interested in conducting a 2019-2022 analysis for uncovering insights that can further progress the organization. This project conducts a focused analysis, investigating trends in MoM & YoY sales, average order value, growth rates, refund rates, and loyalty program performance. The insights garnered will be used for reporting to the Head of Operations, informing teams - Finance, Sales, Product, Marketing - across the company on opportune areas of growth/improvement in a competitive e-commerce landscape.

## Summary of Insights
Conducting an analysis on 108k+ sales records for the years 2019-2022, key insights in the following areas were made:
### 1) Seasonality
Elist observes a notable holiday surge during the months of November & December, increasing 21% & 22% on average, respectively, after consistent declines in October (average -31%). This correlates with general seasonal trends of increased consumer spending during the end-of-year Holiday season - commonly seen in North America - for things such as gift-giving and sales-purchasing. Sales subsequently fell (average -18%) during the January & February months, following the aforementioned seasonal holiday-spend trend. This can be indicative of consumer spending decreasing after the observable surge during the latter months of the year.
