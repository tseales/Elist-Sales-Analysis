# Elist Sales Analysis
Founded in 2018, Elist is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics products and has since expanded to a global customer base. With this expansion, Elist has become interested in conducting a 2019-2022 analysis for uncovering insights that can further progress the organization. This project conducts a focused analysis, investigating trends in MoM & YoY sales, average order value, growth rates, refund rates, and loyalty program performance. The insights garnered will be used for reporting to the Head of Operations, informing teams - Finance, Sales, Product, Marketing - across the company on opportune areas of growth/improvement in a competitive e-commerce landscape.

## Summary of Insights
Conducting an analysis on 108k+ sales records for the years 2019-2022, key insights in the following areas were made:
### 1) Seasonality
Elist observes a notable holiday surge during the months of November & December, increasing 21% & 22% on average, respectively, after consistent declines in October (average -31%). This correlates with general seasonal trends of increased consumer spending during the end-of-year Holiday season - commonly seen in North America - for things such as gift-giving and sales-purchasing. Sales subsequently fell (average -18%) during the January & February months, following the aforementioned seasonal holiday-spend trend. This can be indicative of consumer spending decreasing after the observable surge during the latter months of the year. Interestingly, there is a notable spike in sales during 2020.

### 2) Product & Regional Segmentation
While Elist generated $28.1M in total sales, the "27in 4k gaming monitor" has consitently been the highest selling product. Additionally, while investigating the notable spike in 2020 total sales, the "Macbook Air Laptop" was also found to undergo a sharp increase in sales & is likely the main product responsible for the overall surge. This is likely correlated to the inception of Covid-19 and 2020 shift to remote work/opportunities, causing consumers - e.g. students - to purchase laptops for adjusting to this social change. However, our lowest selling product, "Bose Soundsport Headphones", consisently performs relatively poorly in sales. When taking a bird's eye view at regional product sales, our highest selling product remains consistent amongst all regions - while our lowest selling product is also consistently the worst performer. North America in particular makes up the most of our global sales, with 52% being attributed to this region; contrasting with the lowest percentage being attributed to the Latin American region at 6%.

### 3) Loyalty Program
The loyalty program seemed to perform exponentially well during the aforementioned 2020 spike in total sales, outperforming 2019. While measurements - total sales, AOV, total orders - throughout 2019 & 2020 were less than its non-loyalty counterpart, loyalty program performance began to outpace that of non-loyalty during 2021 & 2022, realizing sales gains of $544k on average. However, loyalty program performance declined in 2022, likely correlating to a reduced consumer need for specific Elist product offerings, due to the social shift of returning to in-person work/opportunities. It would be worth continuing the loyalty program for atleast another year to allow for a more comprehensive understanding of its performance; deeper investigation into the effectiveness of marketing channels & purchase-differentiation amongst the two groups may allow clearer insight(s).

Recommendation
- Investigate higher sales in NA region, and if any contributing factors - like locality - that may play a role into the lower sales numbers for different regions, such as LATAM.
- Investigate the drop in loyalty program sales & value - how we're reaching loyalty customers and what value-driven programs there are for thoe customers.
